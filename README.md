# UTA-Work-Day-Scheduler
Challege 5 for UTA Bootcamp- Work Day Scheduler


## Description:
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I have also added a reset button for the form to be reset at the end of the day or when they want to add different content.
